My main programming skillset comes from C#, but over the years I&rsquo;ve worked with tons of different languages ranging from unknown ones such as MAXScript, to well known ones, such as python, and everything in between.
I&rsquo;m not afraid of trying something new, and am always down for a challenge.
When I&rsquo;m not coding I&rsquo;m either playing games, hanging out with friends or in the gym working out.</p><h3 id=background>Background</h3><p>Back in 2011 a younger me pondered about his future, wondering what he would do after finishing college.
At the time I had yet to know that a path of game-development and software-engineering lied ahead of me.</p><p>In 2012 I made my first steps towards becoming a game-developer by studying game development at the Grafisch lyceum Rotterdam. Over the course of 4 years this would be my introduction to programming, modeling, and various other software skills. The last half year I had closed off as intern at an animation company in Alkmaar.
Content with my performance they offered me a contract for a year, which they had later offered to renew, but I declined.
During my time there I worked on various inhouse tools for 3dsMax, Unity, and Thinkbox Deadline, which optimized the workflow of the users. Examples of these tools include building an Unity project on a &lsquo;render slave&rsquo;, rendering a 3dsMax scene, stitching the individual frames together and adding audio to create a quick video preview for the animators, and more.</p><p>However during my employement at this animation company my thirst for knowledge grew, so even to my own surprise I decided to go to university in 2017 and earn myself a bachelor degree in game development.
Due to my prior experience I quickly grew bored of the lectures, many of which went over the same basics of programming again, as a result of this I joined the honor program which provided me with more challenging lectures and assignments. This effectively made me study both the Game-Development programme and the Software-Engineering programme at the same time. This proved to be too much at times, since the university would expect me to spend about 48 hours per week on lectures and assignments, but with some scheduling and consultation I managed to get through it. My first internship I did at Cronos Amsterdam where I worked on an AI avatar in augmented reality for the Hololens.
For the final half year of my bachelors degree, I did my thesis on AI at a Belgium game company.</p><h3 id=afterwards>Afterwards</h3><p>Afterwards I started working on my own projects to further hone my craft. I started looking into coding C++ and creating an engine with it through OpenGL, afterwards I started writing compute shaders and experimenting with bit manipulation, my focus then changed from compute shaders to actual shaders, and later a combination of the two. And at the time of writing this I&rsquo;m making a dynamic conversation system inspired by various sources.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://westhes.github.io/>&copy; Sebastiaan Westheim 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials><a href=https://github.com/Westhes target=_blank class="github ananke-social-link link-transition stackoverflow link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="GitHub link" rel=noopener aria-label="follow on GitHub——Opens in a new window"><span class=icon><svg style="enable-background:new 0 0 512 512" viewBox="0 0 512 512" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M256 32C132.3 32 32 134.8 32 261.7c0 101.5 64.2 187.5 153.2 217.9 11.2 2.1 15.3-5 15.3-11.1.0-5.5-.2-19.9-.3-39.1-62.3 13.9-75.5-30.8-75.5-30.8-10.2-26.5-24.9-33.6-24.9-33.6-20.3-14.3 1.5-14 1.5-14 22.5 1.6 34.3 23.7 34.3 23.7 20 35.1 52.4 25 65.2 19.1 2-14.8 7.8-25 14.2-30.7-49.7-5.8-102-25.5-102-113.5.0-25.1 8.7-45.6 23-61.6-2.3-5.8-10-29.2 2.2-60.8.0.0 18.8-6.2 61.6 23.5 17.9-5.1 37-7.6 56.1-7.7 19 .1 38.2 2.6 56.1 7.7 42.8-29.7 61.5-23.5 61.5-23.5 12.2 31.6 4.5 55 2.2 60.8 14.3 16.1 23 36.6 23 61.6.0 88.2-52.4 107.6-102.3 113.3 8 7.1 15.2 21.1 15.2 42.5.0 30.7-.3 55.5-.3 63 0 6.1 4 13.3 15.4 11C415.9 449.1 480 363.1 480 261.7 480 134.8 379.7 32 256 32z"/></svg></span><span class=new-window><svg height="8" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1000 1000" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M598 128h298v298h-86V274L392 692l-60-60 418-418H598v-86zM810 810V512h86v298c0 46-40 86-86 86H214c-48 0-86-40-86-86V214c0-46 38-86 86-86h298v86H214v596h596z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd"/></svg></span></a></div></div></div><script defer type=application/javascript src=https://westhes.github.io/js/preview.min.js></script></footer></body></html>
