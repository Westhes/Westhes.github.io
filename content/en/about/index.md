### About
A enthioustic programmer, who first started programming in 2012.  
I love exploring new technologies, researching, and watching game developer conferences / dev-vlogs.
My main programming skillset comes from C#, but over the years I've worked with tons of different languages ranging from unknown ones such as MAXScript, to well known ones, such as python, and everything in between.
I'm not afraid of trying something new, and am always down for a challenge.

### Background

Back in 2011 a younger me pondered about his future, wondering what he would do after finishing college.
At the time I had yet to know that a path of game-development and software-engineering lied ahead of me. 

In 2012 I made my first steps towards becoming a game-developer by studying game development at the Grafisch lyceum Rotterdam. Over the course of 4 years this would be my introduction to programming, modeling, and various other software skills. The last half year that I had closed off at an animation company at Alkmaar.
Content with my performance as junior developer they offered me a contract for a year, which they had offered to renew, but I declined.
During my time there I worked on various inhouse tools for 3dsMax, Unity, and Thinkbox Deadline, which optimized the workflow of the users. Examples of these tools include building an Unity project on a 'render slave', rendering a 3dsMax scene, stitching the individual frames together and adding audio to create a 'quick' video preview for the animators, and more.

However during my employement at this animation company my thirst for knowledge grew, so even to my own surprise I decided to go to university in 2017 and earn myself a bachelor degree in game development.
Due to my prior experience I quickly grew bored of the lectures, many of which went over the same basics of programming again, as a result of this I joined the honor program which provided me with more challenging lectures and assignments. This effectively made me study both the Game-Development programme and the Software-Engineering programme at the same time. This proved to be too much at times, since the university would expect me to spend about 48 hours per week on lectures and assignments, but with some scheduling and consultation I managed to get through it. For the final half year of my bachelors degree, I did my thesis on AI at a Belgium game company.

### Afterwards

Afterwards I started working on my own projects to further hone my craft. I started looking into coding C++ and creating an engine with it through OpenGL, afterwards I started writing compute shaders and experimenting with bit manipulation, my focus then changed from compute shaders to actual shaders, and later a combination of the two. And at the time of writing this I'm making a dynamic conversation system inspired by various sources.
