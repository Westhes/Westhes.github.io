Like many others of my ages I grew up when minecraft was still a brand new thing.\
Inspired by it's grand and amazing worlds I wanted to create something it for the longest time.\
During one of my courses at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences we were tasked to create a procedurally generated object. While this was only meant to be a simple object, I quickly became invested in this technology.\
What started off as a simple line between two points, grew into a triangle from there the possibilities seemed endless.
