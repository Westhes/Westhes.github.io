I&amp;rsquo;m a strong believer that every day is a chance to improve yourself.
I love exploring new technologies, researching, and watching game developer conferences / dev-vlogs. My main programming skillset comes from C#, but over the years I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with tons of different languages ranging from unknown ones such as MAXScript, to well known ones, such as python, and everything in between.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://westhes.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://westhes.github.io/contact/</guid><description>In case you would like to contact me, you can reach me through one of the following channels:
