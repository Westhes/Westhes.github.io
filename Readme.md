# Debug
In order to launch the server run: `.\hugo.exe server`

# Uploading:
Push the master branch and github jobs will do the rest.
If for whatever reason it breaks, make sure that in Github settings, Pages is set to the gh-pages branch, since this is where the github jobs push to.

Note: gh-pages doesn't get pushed too if all the 'release/public' pages are the same.
